## ❓ Frequently Asked Questions

### Is this really free?
Yes! Stale Contacts Cleaner is completely free with no in-app purchases, ads, or hidden costs.

### Does it work offline?
Yes! The app works completely offline since everything happens on your device.

### Will deleted contacts sync to iCloud?
If you have iCloud Contacts enabled, deletions will sync across your devices (this is iOS behavior, not app-specific). If you want to keep deleted contacts on other devices, turn off iCloud Contacts before using the app.

### Can I recover deleted contacts?
Deleted contacts are permanently removed from your iPhone's address book. We recommend backing up your contacts before using the app. Future versions will include export functionality.

### What iOS version is required?
iOS 18.0 or later. The app is optimized for modern iPhones.

### Is my data safe?
Absolutely. Your contacts never leave your device. We don't have servers to send data to. It's architecturally impossible for us to access your data.

### Do you sell my data?
No. We don't collect any data, so there's nothing to sell.

## 🙏 About

Built with ❤️ by [Fabian Williams](https://github.com/fabianwilliams) at [Adotob LLC](https://adotob.com)

**Why build this?**
After years of accumulating contacts, I realized I needed a simple, trustworthy way to clean them up. Every app I found either required cloud sync, collected data, or had confusing interfaces. So I built what I wanted to use myself - a fast, private, simple contacts cleaner.

**Other Projects:**
- [ConferenceHaven](https://conferencehaven.com) - AI-powered conference session discovery
- More coming soon!
