## What is Stale Contacts Cleaner?

**Stale contacts are security risks.** Every old contact in your phone is a potential phishing vector. When someone's account gets hacked, scammers send "urgent" messages to their contacts. If that person is in YOUR contacts, you'll trust it because the name is familiar.

**Stale Contacts Cleaner** helps you reduce your attack surface by making it fast and easy to clean old contacts - in minutes, not hours.

### 🔒 Why This Matters (Security)

**Phishing Risk**: That old coworker from 2019? If their account gets hacked, you'd trust a message from them. Clean your contacts = reduce phishing risk.

**Call Filtering**: iPhone's "Silence Unknown Callers" only works when you have a clean contact list. 1,000 stale contacts? Spam still gets through. Clean to 200 trusted contacts? Feature actually works.

### 🌟 Why Stale Contacts Cleaner?

- 🛡️ **Reduce Phishing Risk** - Fewer stale contacts = smaller attack surface
- 📱 **Swipe Interface** - Keep right, delete left - just like your favorite apps
- 🔐 **100% Private** - All processing on your device, zero data collection
- ⚡ **Fast & Efficient** - Review hundreds of contacts in minutes
- 🔤 **Alphabetical Jump** - Skip to any letter instantly
- ↩️ **Undo Anytime** - Made a mistake? Undo immediately
- 🆓 **100% FREE Forever** - No ads, no in-app purchases, no hidden costs

### ✨ Perfect For

- **Security-conscious users** who want to reduce phishing risk
- **iPhone users** who use "Silence Unknown Callers" (make it actually work!)
- **Anyone with 500+ contacts** who hasn't cleaned in years
- **Privacy-conscious users** who don't trust cloud-based cleaners
- **Parents protecting families** from social engineering scams
- **Anyone** who wants a cleaner, more organized address book

## ❓ Frequently Asked Questions

### Is this really free?
**Yes, 100% FREE forever!** Stale Contacts Cleaner has no in-app purchases, no ads, no subscriptions, and no hidden costs. We built this to solve a real problem we had ourselves. Future "Pro" features (if any) would be optional add-ons - the core cleaning functionality will always be free.

### Does it work offline?
Yes! The app works completely offline since everything happens on your device.

### Will deleted contacts sync to iCloud?
If you have iCloud Contacts enabled, deletions will sync across your devices (this is iOS behavior, not app-specific). If you want to keep deleted contacts on other devices, turn off iCloud Contacts before using the app.

### Can I recover deleted contacts?
Deleted contacts are permanently removed from your iPhone's address book. We recommend backing up your contacts before using the app. Future versions will include export functionality.

### What iOS version is required?
iOS 18.0 or later. The app is optimized for modern iPhones.

### Is my data safe?
Absolutely. Your contacts never leave your device. We don't have servers to send data to. It's architecturally impossible for us to access your data.

### Do you sell my data?
No. We don't collect any data, so there's nothing to sell.

### How do stale contacts increase phishing risk?
When someone's account gets hacked (email, messaging app, phone), scammers send phishing messages to their contacts. If that person is in YOUR contacts, you're more likely to trust the scam because the name is familiar. Every stale contact is a potential attack vector. Security-conscious users practice digital hygiene - including contact list hygiene.

### How does this help with spam calls?
iPhone's "Silence Unknown Callers" feature blocks calls from numbers not in your contacts. Sounds great, right? But if you have 1,000 stale contacts (including that Uber driver from 2019), spam calls still get through. Clean down to 200 trusted contacts, and the feature actually works as intended.

## 🙏 About

Built with ❤️ by [Fabian Williams](https://github.com/fabianwilliams) at [Adotob LLC](https://adotob.com)

**Why build this?**
After years of accumulating contacts, I realized I needed a simple, trustworthy way to clean them up. Every app I found either required cloud sync, collected data, or had confusing interfaces. So I built what I wanted to use myself - a fast, private, simple contacts cleaner.

**Other Projects:**
- [ConferenceHaven](https://conferencehaven.com) - AI-powered conference session discovery
- More coming soon!
