🚀 Launched: Stale Contacts Cleaner - FREE on iOS

🔒 Security PSA: Stale contacts = phishing risks

Every old contact in your phone is a potential attack vector. When someone's account gets hacked, scammers send "urgent" messages to their contacts. If that person is in YOUR contacts, you'll trust it.

I just launched Stale Contacts Cleaner to help solve this:

✅ Swipe interface (Tinder-style) - clean 1,000 contacts in 10 minutes
✅ Reduce phishing attack surface
✅ Make iPhone's "Silence Unknown Callers" actually work
✅ 100% FREE forever - no ads, no tracking, all on-device
✅ Zero data collection - your contacts never leave your phone

Built in 7 days using AI-augmented development. From idea → App Store in one week.

Hey!

Remember how I was talking about building iOS apps? Well... I just launched one! 🎉

It's called Stale Contacts Cleaner. Helps you swipe through your contacts and clean out the old ones (which actually helps with security too - less phishing risk).

Took me 7 days from idea to approved on the App Store. Pretty wild.

Would mean a lot if you checked it out (it's FREE):

## Reddit Post Template (r/SideProject)

**Title:** Launched Stale Contacts Cleaner (iOS) - Security-focused contact cleaning app built in 7 days

**Body:**
```
Hey r/SideProject!

Just launched my first iOS app: **Stale Contacts Cleaner**

**What it does:** Helps you quickly clean stale contacts from your iPhone using a Tinder-style swipe interface.

**Why I built it:** A friend got phished through a compromised old contact. Realized stale contacts are actually security risks - you trust messages from saved contacts even if you haven't talked to them in years.

**The security angle:**
- When someone's account gets hacked, scammers message their contacts
- If that person is in YOUR contacts, you're more likely to trust the scam
- Clean contacts = smaller attack surface

**Secondary benefit:** iPhone's "Silence Unknown Callers" only works if you have a clean contact list. 1,000 stale contacts? Spam still gets through.

**Tech stack:** Swift 6.0, SwiftUI, iOS 18.0+
**Timeline:** Idea → App Store in 7 days using AI-augmented development (Claude Code)
**Pricing:** 100% FREE (no ads, no IAP, no data collection)

**Privacy-first:**
- All processing on-device
- Zero data collection
- No tracking, no analytics
- No account required

**App Store:** https://apps.apple.com/app/stale-contacts-cleaner/id6758899651

Would love your feedback! Also happy to answer questions about the AI-augmented dev process - it was surprisingly effective.
