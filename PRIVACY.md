Everything happens on your iPhone. We don't have servers. We don't track you. We can't see your contacts. You're in complete control.

## Data Collection and Use

### What Data We Access

The App requests access to your **Contacts** to provide its core functionality:
- Reading contact information (names, phone numbers, emails, photos)
- Deleting contacts you choose to remove

### What Data We Collect

**NONE.**

The App:
- ❌ Does NOT collect any personal information

- ❌ Does NOT use cookies, pixels, or trackers

### How Your Data is Used

All contact data processing happens **entirely on your iPhone**:

4. Deleted contacts are removed from your iPhone's address book
5. **NO data leaves your device at any time**

---

## Data Storage

## Your Privacy Rights

### Access
There's nothing to access. We don't collect your data.

### Deletion
There's nothing to delete. We don't store your data.

### Portability
Your contacts remain in iOS Contacts. Use Apple's built-in export features (iCloud, vCard, etc.).

### Objection to Processing
Nothing to object to. We don't process your data beyond displaying and deleting contacts on your device.

## Data Security

Since all processing happens on-device:

- We recommend keeping iOS updated for latest security patches
- Your device encryption protects your data (enabled by default on iOS)

**We cannot access your data even if we wanted to.** The app architecture makes it impossible.
